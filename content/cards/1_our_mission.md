**Curating the FsLab Stack**

We strive to provide exceptional tools for conducting data science in F#. Therefore, we develop and curate the [FsLab stack](https://github.com/fslaborg/FsLab) - a collection of mature, high-quality packages that form a cohesive one-stop solution. Think [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for F#/.NET.

**Fostering an F# Data Science Community**

Whether you've never written a line of code before or you're already a skilled data scientist experimenting with .NET, we aim to have you covered with up-to-date [blog posts](https://fslab.org/blog/), documentation, and [package recommendations](https://fslab.org/packages.html). We provide a safe haven for any data science project in search of new maintainers and/or contributors.
